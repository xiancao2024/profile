            <p>Computer Scientist | Educator | Researcher</p>
            <p><a href="mailto:cao.xian@northeastern.edu"> caoxianlovecoding@gmail.com</a> | Campbell, CA | <a href="(link unavailable)" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
            <p>As a computer science researcher with a healthcare background, I have a unique combination of skills. With a strong foundation in critical thinking and problem-solving, I excel at identifying and addressing the root causes of complex issues. For example, I applied Sentiment Analysis to uncover hidden information behind app reviews.

My expertise in computer science engineering allows me to craft innovative, efficient, and elegant solutions. I have utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create visually appealing websites. Additionally, I have developed multiple web applications, such as a dynamic web application for a restaurant.

Moreover, my healthcare experience has given me a deep passion for crafting products that can improve people's well-being and happiness, considering vulnerable peopleâ€™s needs. This includes improving the accessibility of products to the aging population and disabled individuals.

I'm eager to join a committed team and utilize my skills to create solutions that truly improve people's lives!</p>
